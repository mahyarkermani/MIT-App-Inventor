Android software design with MIT App Inventor

# What is this repository about
I am taking a course on MIT App Inventor at university, so I decided to design and implement smartphone apps at home on the MIT App Inventor website. I publish the coding and output files of this website in this repository and provide explanations about each one. You can also run the files of this project in the MIT App Inventor website, change them, learn something and add something to it, and If you want, email me your files so that I can publish them in this repository with your name.
